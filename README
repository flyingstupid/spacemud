This is a repackaging of the Lil mudlib. It is
incredibly barebones...you get a few commands, and
that's it. This is for folks interested in making
their own "from scratch" lib. Strictly speaking it
isn't "from scratch" if you use it, but man, it's close.

Please note that since you are still using the
FluffOS driver, your mud's use will be subject 
to the MudOS and LPMud licenses.

There is no official support for this. 
If you're actually planning to use
this it's because you are a hardcore...and I mean
*hard* *core*, do-it-yourselfer. So, do it yourself.

Instructions:
-------------

* type: cd fluffos-2.9-ds2.09/
* type: ./configure lil
* type: make
* type: make install
* type: cd ../bin
* type: vi mudos.cfg
* change the mud bin and lib paths to wherever you put the mud.
* type: ./driver ./mudos.cfg &
